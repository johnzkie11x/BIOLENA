                <p>John Biolena is a tall, diligent, and very responsible second-year student aiming to become a police officer. Born in the energetic city of Sorsogon, Philippines, John had always been loved and guided during his childhood. He grew up with two sisters, Crizzia and Cristine Biolena, and parents Rommel and Connie, who taught him the values of hard work, perseverance, and compassion. Sorsogon City is known by peaceful places and close-knit community. It fostered John's personality, aspirations, as well as his appreciation for trust, oneness, and contributing to the whole for the good of all. All these were later complemented by admiration for the role of police officers. Indeed, inspiration offshoots when a career is dedicated to serving and protecting the community as well. Developing skills and confidence needed to be a law enforcement officer is the drive of John as a student. Academic path characterized by discipline and determination has been demonstrated, with an active participation in activities that develop physical and mental strength. Whether it is fitness programs, sports, or community outreach projects, John continually strives to be a better individual and prepare for the rigors of the chosen path. The family has been the greatest motivator to John. Rommel and Connie Biolena have been always there for him to provide a stable and loving home. And Crizzia and Cristine always supported him unconditionally for his dreams. That future will continue to contribute towards a much safer and more peaceful society, giving back to his family to make them proud. To John, being a police officer is more related to serving and good leadership in a fair manner, empathetic, rather than law enforcement. He finds the good police officer safer if he or she can make people safe and collaborate towards that goal. He recalls his childhood in Sorsogon, which has instilled lessons on the value of humility and resilience that define and shape him to this day. Unlike the personal achievement by an individual, success is also measured by the positive changes he causes to people. Such values have been ingrained deeply from personal experiences and continue to lead him forward towards his dream. While moving forward, John still holds the same commitment to become an honorably and compassionately serving police officer. His family is his support base, and he is motivated by the desire to make a difference, making it a reason for him to face challenges while seeing opportunities that lie ahead. This is only the start of a meaningful road to a great career in law enforcement.</p>

                <h2>What is Plagiarism?</h2>
                <p>Plagiarism is the act of using someone else's work, ideas, or intellectual property without proper acknowledgment or permission, presenting it as one's own. This can include copying text, images, or data, as well as paraphrasing someone’s ideas without giving credit. Plagiarism is considered unethical and dishonest in academic, professional, and creative contexts. It can apply to a wide range of materials, including written content, scientific research, art, music, and even software code. The key element of plagiarism is the lack of proper citation or attribution, leading to a misrepresentation of authorship.</p>

                <h2>Report Cases of Plagiarism.</h2>
                <p>University of the Philippines (UP) Students – 2019
                    Plagiarism: In 2019, two students from the University of the Philippines (UP) were involved in a plagiarism controversy after their thesis papers were found to have copied significant portions of content from published research articles and online sources without proper attribution.
                    Consequences: The university investigated the matter, and the students faced academic sanctions. This case emphasized the importance of academic integrity at one of the country's leading institutions and prompted UP to reinforce its policies regarding plagiarism.

                <h2>Nature of Punishment.</h2>
                <p>The nature of the punishment for plagiarism is multifaceted, reflecting the seriousness with which academic institutions, professional organizations, and legal systems view intellectual dishonesty. In educational settings, the immediate consequences often include failure on the assignment or course, with potential for academic probation or even expulsion, depending on the severity of the offense. Beyond academia, plagiarism can lead to significant professional repercussions, such as damage to one's reputation, loss of job opportunities, and legal consequences, including lawsuits or fines, particularly if the infringement involves copyrighted material. These punitive measures are designed not only to penalize the individual but also to uphold the integrity of intellectual work and encourage respect for original authorship.</p>
